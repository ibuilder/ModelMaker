"""Financial statements for a real-estate deal — the three core statements plus tax, built on top of
the proforma `solve()` output (NOI, debt, reversion, cash flows).

- **Income statement** — a stabilized operating P&L (Potential Gross Rent → vacancy/credit loss →
  Effective Gross Income → operating expenses → **NOI**; then interest, **depreciation**, income tax →
  **net income**), plus a year-by-year summary across the hold.
- **Balance sheet** — Assets (land + depreciable improvements net of accumulated depreciation +
  capitalized financing + cash) = Liabilities (loan) + Equity (paid-in + retained). It **balances**
  every year (exposes a `balanced` flag).
- **Cash-flow statement** — GAAP three-section (Operating / Investing / Financing), indirect method
  (net income + depreciation add-back).
- **Tax** — straight-line depreciation (27.5-yr residential / 39-yr commercial; land non-depreciable),
  annual income tax on taxable income, and at sale: **depreciation recapture** (≤25%) stacked on
  **capital-gains** tax (+ NIIT). Drives an **after-tax** IRR / equity multiple.
- **Two-sided budget** — the development budget as **Uses** (left) vs **Sources** (right); both tie.

Pure functions over plain dicts (the solve result + assumptions) so the math is unit-testable.
Institutional defaults are explicit and overridable via the `tax` assumption block; everything is an
estimate, not tax advice.
